# angularjs-webpack Formstack Front End Developer Applicant Assignment



Hello I decided to use npm, webpack, and ES6 as a template.
Hope you'd like the results.

## Dependencies

When you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (Use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* Ensure you're running Node (`v4.1.x`+) and NPM (`2.14.x`+)

## Installing

* `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app with:

`npm start`

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`.

### Build files

* single run: `npm run build`
* build files and watch: `npm start`

## Testing

####Unit Tests

* single run: `npm test`
* live mode: `npm run test-watch`
